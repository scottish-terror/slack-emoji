# slack-emoji
Master stash of slack ready emojis

The chrome extension bulk uploader (slack-emoji-tools) no longer works with slack.  But there's a new way that works better.  Also allows you to sync server emojis across servers, etc.

I put together this program to make using the new tools even faster/easier.   Find all the details about bulk uploading at this README.md

### Contribute!
Remember 
* All images must be gif/png/jpg
* All Images must be 128x128 MAX size
* The filename is what the bulk uploader will use for the Slack :: name, so please name wisely!
* Do not upload duplicate file names
* Make sure the name you use is not a resereved emoji name inside slack.  IE upload your emoji to slack before putting it in the REPO
